ChatTriggers Module :)

List of features: !cps (tells you your clicks per second for the next second) !sc (puts coordinates in chat (requires [patcher](https://sk1er.club/mods/patcher)/[polypatcher](https://modrinth.com/mod/patcher)))

and also says one of a few random messages whenever anyone says anything good about necron/anything bad about frozen blaze or reaper scythe (to toggle change fun from true to false in the top of the index.js)
